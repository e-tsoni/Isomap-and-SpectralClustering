# Isomap-and-SpectralClustering
Isomap algorithm for dimensionality reduction and Spectral Clustering in mnist dataset

1. Isomap algorithm for dimensionality reduction (using the euclidean distance).
2. Spectral Clustering (using undirected k-neighbors graph to calculate the Laplacian matrix).
3. K-means method for clustering.
4. Calculating accuracy in the end is not complete and still needs some work to be done.
